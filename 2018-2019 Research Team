2018-2019 Research Team
This year’s team explored the educational value of gamification of history delivered through an online experience. Our review of the scholarly research lead to a hypothesis that using an online game allows participants to see themselves in each of the moral leader comparators lived experiences as told by the comparator and the original primary source artifacts (i.e., documents and newspapers). The Summer team collected James McFadden’s interview, examined the John Lewis Files, Moorland Springorn Washington DC and identified the technological options for presenting history. The Fall/Spring Team explored the scholarly intersection of the gamification of history, development of ethical decision-making, and delivery through technology. It also continued completed a timeline of John Lewis’ leadership in the 1960s student movement for racial justice. This team presented its progress at the April 2019 Emory University Integrity Conference in Atlanta, GA.
