    <br> <!-- Note from Zac: this floating <br> gives us space between the header and the first about me section--> About the CSCTW Website
  </b><p class="small"> Developed by the interdisciplinary University of Tennessee Leadership Studies Student Research Team, the CSCTW website went live in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the students’ occupation of the Montgomery Co. Courthouse dinner in pursuit of a just society. These students launched the 1960 Alabama State College student sit-ins in Montgomery, Alabama. These events led to precedent-setting court cases - Dixon v. Alabama, 294 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1961) and New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). </p>
  <b>
  <br> About the History of this Project
</b><p class="small"> Dr. Karen D. Boyd and Dr. John W. Lowery began exploring the events surrounding the Dixon v. State of Alabama Board of Education (1961) lawsuit in preparation for its 50th anniversary in 2010. Dr. Boyd presented her findings in introducing Attorney Fred Gray, the counsel who filed the case for the expelled students, as the keynote for the Opening Session the 2010 Association for Student Conduct Administrators annual meeting. The Opening Session also included a 50th Anniversary panel with St. John Dixon, James McFadden, and Attorney Gray hosted by Tamara King (the 2010 ASCA president). The Opening Session was immediately followed by a closed door interview of the panel and a follow-up open panel discussion hosted by Dr. Lowery. Each of those sessions were recorded (The ASCA 2010 Tapes).
Since that beginning Dr. Boyd has continued to collect activist interviews and presentations, visit over 8 archives, and lead undergraduate and graduate student research teams to explore the leadership exhibited by and lived experiences of college students associated with the 1960s Civil Rights Movement for Racial Justice.
Beginning in Fall 2018, Dr. Boyd (ELPS) and Professor Cary Staples (Design) launched the University of Tennessee Leadership Studies’ transdisciplinary research team working with graduate and undergraduate students HEAM/CSP/LMS/LSM-H/Design) to continue collecting and processing the historical data to produce Montgomery 1960 – an online experiential immersive game that brings the Spring of 1960 to life for the user.
