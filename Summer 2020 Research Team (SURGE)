Summer 2020 Research Team
SURGE
The SURGE research team re-engineered the original Montgomery 1960 prototype to improve the technological accessibility and diverse student engagement in the experience. The team used a Participatory Action Research approach to engage in design thinking, game building, historical primary source analysis, production, and play testing with the goal of improving the accessibility and relevance of the product to African-American, lower socioeconomic status, and first generation college students. They will collaborate with the living student sit-in participants to better organize and interpret the historical content into a working prototype, while validating authenticity of the activists’ lived experienced conveyed in the game.
