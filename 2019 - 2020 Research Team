2019 - 2020 Research Team
The 2019-2020 Undergraduate Research team designed and prototyped the game logic and graphic interface inside the ARIS (Augmented Reality Interactive Storytelling) platform. Montgomery 1960, an experiential-learning curricular tool, teaches empathy and perspective-taking through history. Players learn these skills, which are foundational to intercultural and ethical sensitivity, (Swaner, 2005) though immersion into the lived experiences of and challenges faced by the historical events’ participants.

The team’s research accepted invitations to present its research at: 1) the Undergraduate Research Poster Session of the American History Association January 2020 in New York City, NY; 2) Keynoted with the activists the Association for Student Conduct Administration and follow up session February 2020 in Crystal City VA; 3) National Association of Student Personnel Administrators in Austin, Tx (a 2020 NASPA Innovative Program; but canceled due to COVID-19); and the National Conference on Undergraduate Research 2020 in Boseman, MT (also canceled due to COVID-19).
