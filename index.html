    Students can and have made a difference in the world we live in today. <a class="emph">College Students Change the World</a> believes that  students' stories offer relatable exemplars who inspire others to become leaders of positive impactful change. We are a community of educators and students providing online resources that facilitate the collection, organization, and sharing of student leadership success stories to educate the personally and socially leaders of tomorrow. Please cite all resources found on this website as designated for each source.
    <br><br>
    This is the first phase in an online archive of primary and secondary source documents collected by Dr. Boyd, her colleagues, and students. This site also includes educational resources which integrate these historical findings and provides a theoretical framework for collecting your own stories. Developed by the interdisciplinary University of Tennessee Leadership Studies Student Research Team, the CSCTW website went live on February 25th, 2020 in commemoration of the moment students entered the Montgomery Co. Courthouse diner exactly 60 years ago. These students launched the 1960 Montgomery Alabama State College student sit-ins which led to the Dixon v Alabama State Board of Education (1961) and New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964) which are precedent-setting court decisions.
