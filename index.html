    Students can and have made a difference in the world we live in today. <a class="emph">College Students Change the World</a> believes that  students' stories offer relatable exemplars who inspire others to become leaders of positive impactful change. <!-- (Note from Zac: Commenting this line out for edits from DKB on 8/5/20) We are a community of educators and students providing online resources that facilitate the collection, organization, and sharing of student leadership success stories to educate the <u class="check">personally and socially leaders of tomorrow.</u> Please cite all resources found on this website as designated for each source <u class="check">(Repetitive because of paragraph below?)</u>.

    <!--Note from Zac: I moved the content in this comment to the about me page on 8/5/20: Developed by the interdisciplinary University of Tennessee Leadership Studies Student Research Team, the CSCTW website went live in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the students’ occupation of the Montgomery Co. Courthouse dinner in pursuit of a just society. These students launched the 960 Alabama State College student sit-ins in Montgomery, Alabama. These events led to precedent-setting court cases - Dixon v. Alabama, 294 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1961) and New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). -->
