      Every college has stories of its students' actions that changed the world. Our vision for College Students Change the World is to assist you in collecting and sharing students' stories using our frameworks for gathering and organizing your primary sources into theoretically effective educational resources. As organized, these resources increase student ethical and intercultural competency by developing empathy and perspective taking. <br><br>

      We have found that communicating complex historical stories within a newspaper format increases accessibility. We offer the following framework to facilitate both your collection and organization of that story. We hypothesize that this framework best shares this content and accomplishes these learning outcomes (examining this hypothesis is the primary role of this undergraduate research team). This framework is based on Rest's Major Components of Morality and Ethical Action (Rest, 1984; Rest, Narveaz, Bebeau, and Thoma, 1999). We propose that you organize your (newspaper) story by these (headlines) components asking the following questions to identify how best to do that. To most activate perspective taking, organize your data with:
      <ul>
        <li>an <i>awareness/sensitivity</i> headline,
        <li>a <i>motivation/commitment</i> headline,
        <li> a <i>moral character</i> headline (i.e., strength to see it through/fulfill the ethical imperative), and
        <li>two <i>judgement/decision-making</i> headlines.
      </ul>
<h2>Headline Content Theoretical Filter Questions</h2>
<i>Sensitivity</i> (Scene 1)
<ul><li>What were the ethical issues that drove your perspectives/actions in this event?
<li>What made you aware that it was an ethical issue?
</ul>

<i>Commitment</i>  (Scene 2)
<ul><li>What do believe about yourself, as a moral being?
<li>What do your words and actions say about who you are?
<li>What are your values and what do you value?
<li>What do your actions say about how you prioritize each in relation to one another? <li>What matters most to you?
</ul>

<i>Character/Action</i> (Scene 3)
<ul><li>What did you do?
<li>What made it hard?
<li>What gave you the strength to do it?
</ul>

<i>Judgement/Decision-Making</i> (Identify 2 of ethical decisions comparators made, but are relevant to today [ex. Black Lives Matter]) (Scene 4 and 5)
<ul><li>What is the most “right” answer – What action did you take because it was right?
<li>Does an ethical imperative drive your answer - What principle drove your actions?
<li>What makes you say that - Why did you think your actions reflect that principle? How might they not?
</ul>
